HoverMaker javascript library.

GIT REPOSITORY INCLUDES TWO VERSIONS.
One depends on prototype.js; the other depends on jQuery. Feel free to use either.

Simplifies the process of adding hover states to images in a web page.
Just add a classname ("hover" by default) to the images that should have hover states.
Name the images according to a convention (image.png and image-over.png for example), 
or set up an object with custom over- and off-state filenames.
Instantiate this object, and let it take over.
